Task 4 - Project: Movie Rental Analysis System

This project focuses on performing OLAP-based analysis on a movie rental system using PostgreSQL or Amazon Redshift. A single consolidated table, rental_data, is created with key information about rentals such as movie genre, customer ID, rental and return dates, and rental fee.

The goal is to explore multidimensional analysis through OLAP operations including:

    Drill Down from genre level to movie level

    Rollup to summarize rental fees by genre and overall

    Cube to analyze rental totals across all combinations of genre, date, and customer

    Slice to extract only "Action" genre rentals

    Dice to filter rentals of specific genres within a recent time frame

This project showcases how OLAP operations can be applied in SQL to derive insights from structured transactional data, providing a powerful toolset for data warehousing and reporting.
